# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. ROS 2 Integration
Every robotic system must leverage ROS 2 as its foundational nervous system, ensuring modularity, communication, and interoperability.

### II. Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo + Unity)
Development and testing must utilize digital twin environments (Gazebo and Unity), providing a safe, scalable, and efficient platform for simulating physical AI behaviors.

### III. NVIDIA Isaac for AI-Robot Brain
NVIDIA Isaac must be employed as the primary framework for AI-robot brain development, facilitating advanced perception, reasoning, and action capabilities.

### IV. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Pipelines
All AI systems connecting digital intelligence to physical robotic behavior must incorporate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines for comprehensive understanding and interaction with the physical world.

### V. Autonomous Humanoid Capstone
The capstone project will focus on developing an autonomous humanoid capable of responding to voice commands, performing LLM planning, navigation, object detection, and manipulation tasks.

### VI. Deliverables and Audience Focus
The project must deliver a complete Docusaurus-based technical book with an integrated RAG chatbot, deployed to GitHub Pages, targeting intermediate-to-advanced AI/robotics students and engineering teams.

## Purpose

Create a complete Docusaurus-based technical book using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code, covering Physical AI, Embodied Intelligence, and Humanoid Robotics. The book must include a fully functional RAG chatbot.

## Scope

AI systems in the physical world (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA pipelines). Focus on connecting digital intelligence to physical robotic behavior.

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified.
